        <h1>Antibiotics vs Probiotics</h1>
        <img src= "IMG_2141.JPG">
        <h6>Based on the opinion of Lyndon Lewis and not 
        fact.</h6> <h2>Antibiotics</h2>
        
        <p>The word "anti" means against and the word
        "biotic" refers to Life, the condition of
        living organisims. So combined, the word 
        "antibiotic" means "against life." In the 
        medical field, "antibiotics" is usually the 
        medicine/drug that is prescribed to kill 
        and or cure a specific harmful infection or 
        bacteria. The gut is full of bacteria (both 
        good and bad) that are used by the body 
        in the digestive process or as a part of 
        the digestive system. Antibiotics will kill 
        them both so the digestive process/system 
        could potentially suffer as a result of 
        it's use or over use.</p> 
        <h2>Probiotics</h2>
        <img src= "IMG_2140.JPG">
        <p>Probiotics are live 
        microorganisms that are intended to have 
        health benefits. Although people often think 
        of bacteria and other microorganisms  as 
        harmful "germs", many help our bodies to 
        function properly. For example, there are 
        microorganisms/bacteria in our intestines 
        that help to digest food, destroy 
        disease-causing microorganisms, and 
        produce vitamins.</p> <p>For more information,
