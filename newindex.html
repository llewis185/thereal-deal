        <h1>Live Enzymes and the Human Body</h1>
        <h2>The Benefits of Eating Live Enzymes</h2>
        <p>There are many benefits to adding live enzymes to your everyday diet. Whether breaking down foods or healing from injury, almost every process in the human body involves chemical reactions. Each and every cell in the human body uses enzymes for building, maintenance, and repair. Enzymes are available in food, and the human body produces many enzymes on it's own. However, your body's natural production of enzymes begins to decline as early as age 25. Joint pain, circulatory problems, slower healing, and an increase in the incidence of disease are all too common with people who are enzyme difficient and suffering the effects of aging.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Enzymes</h3>
        <p>Natural enzymes fall into two main categories: systemic enzymes and digestive enzymes. Some enzymes are made by your body, other enzymes are found naturally in certain foods or available as a supplement. Getting the right amount of enzymes in your body can help support digestion, reduce inflammation and boost your immune system. Many plant-based foods provide a good source of enzymes. Following a healthy organic diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables is a great way to provide your body with a wide variety of enzymes.</p>
