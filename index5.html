    <h2>Why Exercise?</h2>
    <img src="IMG_6436.JPG">
    <p>Truth is the best way to keep your body and mind in tip
        top shape is to be physically active. No matter what his
        or her physical condition, almost everyone can engage in
        at least some form of bodily exercise. To be at your best,
        you should follow the guidelines for your age and overall
        health status. However, each and every one of us can certainly
        exercise our minds even if our bodies don't always cooperate.</p>

    <h3>Reduces blood pressure</h3>
    <p>The number one cause of heart disease is Chronic Hypertension.
        Some causes of Hypertension include the increased plaque in the
        arteries that builds up from consuming a high-fat diet. Exercise
        helps to reduce your blood pressure, in part, by attacking
        plaque in your arteries. As the arteries widen, the blood flows
        through more freely, and your blood pressure eventually
        starts to drop. Hypertension also decreases as the result of exercise
        because your heart, a muscle, is getting a workout. The stronger your
        heart muscle gets, the greater it's ability to pump blood through the
        arteries, which also helps to reduce your blood pressure.</p>
    <h3>Know Where You Stand</h3>
    <p>As you probably already know, Type 2 diabetes is becoming
        a world-wide public health crisis. Even if you don't care
        about the health of the world, you should care about your own
        risk of diabetes.</p>
